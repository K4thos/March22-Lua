#March22-Lua Changelog
##NOTE: I hardly ever remember what I add per version, so it may be inaccurate

#### v0.2.0
- Improved script loading
- Added a loading bar function
- RPYtoLua
	* C++ program that converts RPY script to March22-Lua-compliant Lua script.
	* Currently only converts dialogue and sound/background changes, with no transition.
	* Requires setup to charnames and charnames_fixed, similar to RPY-eBook.
- Other stuff I probably forgot.

#### v0.1.0
